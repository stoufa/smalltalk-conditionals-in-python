Emulating Smalltalk's Conditionals in Python

Influenced by the talk of Sandi Metz [Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE), I started thinking how to apply these rules on Python. Like Ruby, Python also contains the keyword `if`, so how to transform its conditional syntax to a nicer Object-oriented message-sending syntax ?
